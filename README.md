<h1>Simple Technique to upload file in from React.js to Node.js.</h1>

In this repo, I'll be working on how to upload the files using React.js in a secure, efficient manner.

<hr/>

**Clone the repo**ðŸš€: <i>Note: You can start from scratch
too.</i>

1. Run on terminal
   `https://github.com/sangya2001/File-Upload-in-React.js`
2. Get into the folder and run
   `npm i`


### Things to notice:
1. Packages used: `axios` & `react-toastify`
2. `@dev` denotes the note for the developers
3. `const [file, setFile] = React.useState({ selectedFile: null, uploaded: false })`: Here file has been stored to a variable inside file object.
4. `e.target.files[0]`: This denotes files are stored in an array inside the browsers.
